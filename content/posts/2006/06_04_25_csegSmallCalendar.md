I continue working in my csegSharePoint library. Meanwhile Iâ€™m doing some test with this, as this webpart that is a small calendar that show a date field from a list, and  it allows select the dates witth entries, and provide a cell value with the date. You can select the List and the Field and the styles to draw the calendar.

Also you can use this with csegRollUp to filter by dates, using [CellProvider] in queries.
