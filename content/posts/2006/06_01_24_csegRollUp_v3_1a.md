![csegRollUp](/images/Sharepoint/csegRollUp-v31a.gif)

## Fixes

– Queries with fields that contains spaces
– Variables in caml queries
– Other minor bugs

## Improvements (awaited :-) )

Now there is a new property “From top level” where you can specify the starting point from which the csegrollup would gather the information, this url can be a site or a portal area. The format is an Url format (http://sever/sites/site or http://server/area), Now you can use csegRollUp in an area and rollup content from sites in other areas or others urls, also you can use csegRollUp in a site/subsite and agregate content from a top site.
