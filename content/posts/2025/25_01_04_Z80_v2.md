## Z80 v2

I'm not sure but still soon to say that this year will be the year of the Z80. I've been working on a new version of the Z80 computer that I've built last year. The new version that I have in mind will have a lot of improvements over the previous one, and possibly a printed circuit board (PCB) to make it more professional.

Improvements that I have in mind:

- Easy to upload programs to the computer
- RS232 interface
- SD card interface
- Some kind of BUS to add more peripherals (like RC2014 does, compatible with it?)
- CPM compatible
- More memory? 128K?
