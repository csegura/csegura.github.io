## Installing an SD Card Interface on the Apple IIc

Finally I got the SP ][ SD interface for the Apple IIc. This interface allows you to connect an SD card to the Apple IIc and use it as a mass storage device. The installation is quite simple, and the results are amazing.

It use an arduino nano to manage the SD card and the communication with the Apple IIc. The interface is connected to the disk II port of the Apple IIc, and it is powered by the Apple IIc itself. Great design!

The best thing is that you can use the SD card to load programs quickly, and you can also save your work on it. In the SD card you can store four ProDOS-formatted 32MB PO files.
