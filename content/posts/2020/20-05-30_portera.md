## Motivation

These days I spent more time at home by corona quarantine, time to practice and learn new things. I began to do a sample project in node for the company where I work, it was something that I had have in my mind time ago. The project its a middleware between our different management programs and third part applications, this middleware should contain all bussiness logic necesary by thrird part systems.

When I had this part finished, I was adding a GraphQL interface to learn about it. Then I had a lot of api queries and results from my program and I needed inspect then, to understand how queries were formed and verify the results.

Then I had another problem, it was that I had only my laptop and it have a little screen, between the code editor and browser I didnÂ´t have enaugh screen to show everything. Then I thought that I could use my tablet as a remote log viewer, and here is the result !!!
