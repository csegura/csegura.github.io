I am working in three webparts for handling alerts in Sharepoint, as advance here is first of them. 

**csegUserListsAlerts**

This webpart shows
 
1) A drop-down list with all the lists of the Web site in where it is located.   
2) The name of the current user  
3) One lists with all the users of the Web site  
4) The alerts for the selected list

You can do:

Eliminate the selected alert  
Eliminate all alerts for the current list  
Add alert to selected users (specify type and frecuency)  
Add alerts to all users
 
The webpart screenshot has texts in spanish but the download webpart is translated to english.

The next webpart would show a drop-down list with all users and your alerts. The third webpart is a webpart for information to show current user alerts.
