Days ago I showed my last toy project called CAML Editor, this first sketch was only a test application. Now I have the pleasure to announce that the first version is here to stay ;-) .

• New tabbed interface
• Code completion and folding support in text editor
• CAML code generator completely rewritten
• Many Bugs fixed
• New Validation error interface inside of the editor
