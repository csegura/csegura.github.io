There are things that I do not understand (too many) of SharePoint, today I have paid attention in the actions menu in image libraries, there is an action called “View all Folders” that not exist in document libraries, trying to solve this problem, I have had the idea to how to do a pretty webpart to **Copy and Paste** documents in documents libraries (this is in mind).

But, first les us solve the problem of view all folders in document libraries. I have spent an interesting short time  while seeing as the pages generated by sharepoint work, and there is an stupid trick to solve the problem.  It is enough with adding a link with javascript.

You can use FrontPage to add the simple link

`Javascript:window.navigate(ctx.HttpRoot + "/\_layouts/3082/folders.aspx?List=" + ctx.listName)`

If you prefer you can put a content editor webpart and paste this code to add a custom menu action with the link.


```js
<script language="javascript">
function Custom_AddDocLibMenuItems(m, ctx)
{
    var strDisplayText = "View all Folders";
    var strUrl = ctx.HttpRoot + "/_layouts/3082/folders.aspx?List=" + ctx.listName;
    var strAction = 'window.navigate(strUrl)';
    CAMOpt(m, strDisplayText, strAction, "");
    return false;
}
</script>
```

Remember change the 3082 (spanish) for your lenguaje code.
