**From my old blog posted on Sat 15/02/2003**

I have a Palm m505. It's a great little device. I use it for keeping track of my schedule, contacts, and to-do lists. I also use it to read e-books and play games. I've had it for about a year now, and I'm still finding new uses for it. I've even written a few programs for it. It's amazing how much you can do with such a small device. I highly recommend it to anyone who needs to keep track of their schedule, contacts, and to-do lists. It's a great little device.

## SuperWaba for Palm – CRelated program
  
This is a small program written in SuperWaba to see pending tasks and completed ones. I have written it in a silly hour and it is my first program in SuperWaba, but at moment it solves the problem. (by the way SuperWaba in a slow little bit)  
         
I use Agendus, bacause in each descriptions of tasks and calendar entries, it's contains the name of the company.  
      
Description **Contact (Company)**
      
**we work with people and we bill to the companies**  
         
Program shows all companies stored in the database of contacts, and it filters them, if there are contacts of the same company.

Once selected one company, we can select if we want to see, tasks or appointments/meetings.
