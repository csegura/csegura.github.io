We have prepared the new SPSRollUp v3 in few days.

* Improved performance
* Now there is not necessary to apply changes twice.
* New Xslt functions. Added FormatIsoDate, LookupValue, LookupId, Replace, RootWebUrl, SourceParam, UrlParam, XmlDecode (more information in SPSNamespace functions)
* New View Lists and View Fields options to show crawled lists and fields.

Now there are two options in the configuration properties that will show a popup with the information about collected lists and fields.

Lists and Fields Information will help you to select the correct data in the configuration properties


* New Order results by

When you add the order by in the CAML Query the results will be ordered in lists sets. Now using the “Order results by” the whole results will be ordered using indicated fields.
