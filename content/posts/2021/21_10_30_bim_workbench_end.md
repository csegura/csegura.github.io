It is time to move on to the next project. The BIM Workbench project is finished.

Was an incredible journey, I learned a lot about Autodesk Forge, Vue.js, Node.js, and the Revit API. I am very happy with the result, and I am looking forward to the next project. 

Here are some videos of the project:

This part shows the integration with Power BI mixing all the data from the project, and showing it in a dashboard in Power BI. Everything at the same time that the user is working on the project in Revit.
