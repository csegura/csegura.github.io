## C128 RGB Video 80col cable

The C128 seems to be lossing the brightness signal in the Composite output, the video is fine but the colors are not as bright as they should be.

I've decided finally do the cable to connect the C128 rgbi output using composite video. The cable is a simple DB9 pin to phono RCA cable, ground to pin 1 and video signal to pin 7.

This get an 80col video output but only in C128 mode, the C64 mode is not supported. I'm looking for other options to fix it in the future. But at least I can use the 80col mode in the C128 to test a new 1571 drive :-).
