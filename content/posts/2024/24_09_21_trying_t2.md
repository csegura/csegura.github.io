## Trying T2sde Linux on a Sun Sparcstation 5

I have a Sun Sparcstation 5, it has installed NetBSD 9, that was the nearest OS that I could install on it. I wanted to try Linux on it, years ago I was able to install linux on a Ultra 1, from the network using a TFTP server and the process was fun. I learned a lot.

Recently I had read about T2sde, a distribution that supports a lot of architectures, including SPARC. I decided to give it a try. There a lot of packages available, and the process sounds easy, and the best the have one of the most recent versions of the Linux kernel. Amazing!

### Installation

I downloaded the ISO from the [official site](https://www.t2sde.org/), and I burned it to a CD. I booted the Sparcstation 5 from the CD, and the installation process started. The process is very similar to the NetBSD installation process:
