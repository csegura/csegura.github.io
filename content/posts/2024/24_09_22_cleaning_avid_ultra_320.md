## Cleaning Avid Ultra 320/LVD SCSI Drives

I recently acquired a couple of Avid Ultra 320/LVD SCSI drives. These drives are used in the Avid DS Nitris system, which is a high-end video editing system. The drives are: 

- 2 x 146GB Seagate Cheetah 15K.5 drives.
- 2 x 300GB IBM Ultrastar 10K300 drives.

The drives are in good condition, but they have been sitting in storage for a while. I decided to clean them before using them.

### Cleaning

I started by cleaning the drives with a microfiber cloth. I removed any dust and dirt from the drives. I then used a can of compressed air to blow out any remaining dust from the drives.
