I have been repairing the Dragon 32 

When I powered it up, the screen was all garbled. I opened it up and found a capacitor that was bulging.

First attempt to fix it was to replace the bulging capacitor. I replaced it with a new one, but after powering it up, the cursor was missing.

Finally I have had to replace most of the capacitors on the board.
