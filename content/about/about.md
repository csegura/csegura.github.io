Hello there! I'm a bit of a tech wizard who thrives in the realm of ones and zeros. Programming languages? I speak them like second languages, whether it's for crafting complex code or tinkering with the innards of retro computing systems. I'm all about blending the nostalgia of vintage electronics with cutting-edge tech solutions. You'll often find me deep in the guts of a Commodore 64 or reprogramming my environment just for kicks. If it beeps, clicks, or has a blinking light, I'm there.

Years ago I started a blog to share my tech adventures with the world. Then I was a Microsoft MVP and a SharePoint enthusiast. I created a few web parts and tools that helped people get more out of their SharePoint sites. You can find some of my old projects in the blog archives.

Before that, I was a software engineer at a few companies, working on everything from web applications to embedded systems. I've always been fascinated by the intersection of hardware and software, and I've spent countless hours building and programming my own gadgets.

In 90s, I had a BBS and I was a sysop of a FidoNet node. Still remember the sound of the modem connecting to the BBS and the excitement of downloading a new game or chatting with someone on the other side of the world.

I've since moved on to other projects, but I've kept the blog alive as a time capsule of my journey. Feel free to browse around and see what I've been up to. Who knows, you might find something that sparks your curiosity or inspires your next project. If you have any questions or just want to chat, feel free to reach out. I'm always up for a good tech talk!
